Build_3rdParty_Library
======================

This is a template shell script to cross compile third party library for iOS. You can use it to build most of open source libraries. Works with Xcode5 and upper.

Just copy this script file to your source folder and run. It will genrate fat binary you want.

OK, you still need a little change.
